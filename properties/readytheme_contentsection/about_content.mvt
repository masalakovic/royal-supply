				<h2>Our Founder</h2>
				<h3>Jon Bresler</h3>
				<p>Jon Bresler founded LAFCO after becoming accustomed to the aromatherapy traditions in Europe after living in Switzerland. He launched LAFCO by introducing and distributing European skincare and artistic perfumery brands, including Santa Maria Novella, Claus Porto, Korres Natural Skin Care, Lorenzo Villoresi and Eau dâ€™Italie perfumes into the United States. Years later, he established LAFCO as its own brand inspired by the tradition and experience of a European apothecary.</p>
				<p>With roots in botanical skin care and niche perfumery, and because the mission is to create products that look, smell, feel good and are good for you, the brand centers around exceptional fragrance, thoughtful craftsmanship, ethical practices and the finest pure materials. </p>
