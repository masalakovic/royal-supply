<p>Five generations of the Swanes family have owned and operated Northern Fish Products, Inc. The business was purchased in 1912 by Johannes Swanes, a Norwegian immigrant. His purchase included a horse and a wagon for fresh fish distribution. From this humble beginning, we have become one of the premier suppliers of fish and seafood in the Pacific Northwest. Northern Fish is one of the oldest family owned and operated businesses in the state of Washington.</p>
<p>Northern Fish’s distinct geographic advantage for procuring the unique seafood products of the Pacific Northwest and Alaska, along with our team of buying experts who know where, when and how to get the highest quality seafood and means a consistently better product coming to your door.

Our quality control and safety measures exceed all mandated regulations; in many cases setting the standard for excellence.</p>

We are committed to maintaining the successful course we have traveled for the past century by continuing to provide our customers the service and quality they expect from us.
